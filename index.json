I follow never-ending advancements in technology passionately and their impacts on human society. I am keen on Cryptography and trying to explore the intersection of Deep Learning and Cryptography.\nAt IIT Roorkee, I am a member of a Deep Learning-centric discussion group named the Vision and Language Group. As a person, I adore discussing various random topics and love to play hockey and football. I used to relax by listening to music and roaming inside the campus. I am in the Official Hockey team of IIT Roorkee under National Sports Organization and used to follow the sport avidly. I like to talk to new people and feel free to connect to discuss any random topic.\n","date":1622419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1622419200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://Sandstorm831.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I’m an engineering undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, enthusiastic about Deep learning and its progress within the past few years.
