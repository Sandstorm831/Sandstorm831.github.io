title: 'ResNet-50'
#subtitle: Waiting for neural networks to train is always the most annoying time and even more ennoying  when the datasets are large. Indeed, but changing #the optimization algorithm may bring a significant change in speed as well as accuracu for the deep learning model training.

ResNet-50 is a pretrained convolutional neural network that is trained on over a million images from the ImageNet database. It has 177 layers with 192 connections. It can classify images in 1000 categorical outputs. It has an input image size of 224 x 224 x 3.
