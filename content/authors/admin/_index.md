Thanks for visiting my portfolio page! I'm an undergraduate mathematician with a passion for research, as well as a strong interest in the fields of mathematics and cryptography.

I've always been captivated by the brilliance and beauty of mathematics. My enthusiasm for mathematics has only grown over the years, and I've continued to study the topic both formally and on my own. I have a strong desire to use research to advance inÂ mathematics today.

I am drawn to the subjects of deep learning and cryptography in addition to mathematics. I find it fascinating how these fields integrate computer science and mathematical theory to address challenging issues.I believe that crossover of deep learning and cryptography have tremendous potential to transform the world we live in, and I am eager to contribute to these fields in any way I can.

I participate in the Vision and Language Group at IIT Roorkee, a discussion group that focuses on deep learning. As a person, I enjoy talking about a wide range of unrelated subjects and enjoy playing football and hockey. I used to wander around the campus while listening to music to unwind. I used to be an avid hockey fan and currently play for the IIT Roorkee official hockey team in the National Sports Organization. I enjoy conversing with new people and am open to connecting to talk about any unrelated subject.
