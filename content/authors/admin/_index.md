I'm an engineering undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee enthusiastic about Deep learning and its progress within past few years. I follow never ending advancements in technology passionately and their impacts on human society. I am keen on Cryptography and trying to explore in the intersection of Deep learning and Crytpography.

At IIT Roorkee, I am a member of a Deep Learning-centric discussion group named the [Vision and Language Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io/). As a person, I adore discussing various random topics and love to play hockey and football. I used to relax myself by listening to music and roaming inside the campus. I am in the Official Hockey team of IIT Roorkee under National Sports Organization and used to follow the sport avidly. I like to talk to new people and feel free to connect for discussing any random topic.
