summary: Begginer freindly workshop on transfer learning in pytorch.
abstract: "I have taken a workshop on Transfer Learning. In it, I have explained Transfer Learning from scratch and given an intuition of how not only does it make a new model comparable to a good model without any training but also impart the same bias that the previous model is suffering from. I have provided all the participants with a colab notebook to follow the procedure quickly."
